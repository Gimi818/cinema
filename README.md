# Cinema
## A cinema management application with a ticketing system
The new user registers within the application and verifies their email by clicking the activation link received in their email.
Then, the user selects a screening date and a film for that specific time, checking seat availability for the screening. In the next step, the user books a ticket, selects a seat, row and chooses the type of discount."
After a successful booking, the application sends an email with the ticket in PDF format with all the details and a unique QR code to confirm the details and the purchase of the ticket.
The cinema offers two types of discounts: 
Events: Cheap Tuesday and Cheap Friday, during which ticket prices are discounted by 30%.
Student discounts: with an additional 15% reduction in ticket prices.
Administrators have the authority to add new films to the database and create new screenings, specifying the date, time, and film.

I used a MySQL database to implement the relationships in the database.
The application is deployed on Docker and has an implemented swagger.
